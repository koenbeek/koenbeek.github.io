# Webtools

## Basic webtools

This github repo contains some basic text-web-tools 

They can be used 
1. online [here](https://koenbeek.github.io) or 
2. you can download the docs folder/webtools folder and serve it with a webserver or 
3. you can download the webtoolz folder and access the webtools with the browser directly with the file:// protocol - they don't use any .js files to avoid CORS errors with file:// protocol but some javascript is duplicated in each html

## List of tools

check out the [basic doc](docs/README.md) and some [examples](docs/Examples.md)
